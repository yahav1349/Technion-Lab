Grillo's Pickles,Project Manager,Associate,"Who Are We?Grillo’s Pickles is a Boston-native company founded in 2008. Over the past 15 years, we have grown from selling our 100-year-old pickle recipe out of a handmade pickle cart on the streets of Boston to a nationwide brand with passionate fans across all corners of the US. Now part of the Irresistible Foods Group (IFG) along with King’s Hawaiian and Shaka Tea, we are continuing to redefine the pickle category and show the world that good is not good enough. Not bad for a pickle in a lawn chair.We're in the business of fresh. Fresh is more than a clean ingredient label or where we're sold. It's about creating fresh products out of a handmade pickle cart and flipping the script on how to build an amazing brand with a passionate fan base. It's about sharing our fresh perspective, style, and values with the world. It's about punching above our weight class, shooting our shot, saying “yes” to big opportunities and then figuring it out. We are fearlessly passionate, authentic, and true to who we are. We accredit our growth to our commitment to staying true to our roots and never straying away from the values that drive us:Quality First. We can’t say we make the World’s Best Pickle if we don’t. Our brand is built entirely on delivering an incredible experience, one pickle at a time, and the trust we earn from our customers and fans that keeps them coming back for more. We’re committed to quality even if it’s harder, takes longer, or costs more. We won’t cut corners or settle for less. And quality first is not just for our products, but our people too.Hustle Harder. Other brands might have bigger budgets, but we have heart, grit, and resourcefulness, and they’ve gotten us this far. We do more with less. We think bolder and more creatively to overcome roadblocks and turn scrappy ideas into huge opportunities.Respect & Dignity. When we started out, the people in the park were our first customers. We didn’t care if they lived there, worked nearby, or were just passing through. Our pickles brought them together. Everyone is welcome to be a part of this thing we’re building. No prejudices, no assholes. We show everyone the same respect, honesty, and kindness that we would want shown to us.Drive Fast, Take Smart Chances. The ability to listen to our fans, our partners, and the market and react quickly lets us take advantage of unique opportunities that others can’t. Being responsive, willing to take risks, and embrace the unconventional approach is what sets us apart and will help us get and stay ahead of the competition.Positive Vibes. From the earliest days in the park to NY Pickle Fest to Expo, we can turn anything into a party. We don’t take ourselves too seriously, and we aren’t afraid to be ourselves – make a little noise, have some fun, and stand out. We started out making pickles for a living – that’s insane.These values are not only what drive us, but also what we seek in all members at all levels in our company. If this sounds like something you want to be a part of, why don’t you join our family?Who Are You?You are an authentic, dedicated, and creative problem solver who is highly motivated by the opportunity to take the growth of a fast-growing brand to the next level. You don’t “manage” people or things; you “lead” them, you “create” them. You’re a thinker, builder, and an inspirer, not a manager. You see problems to be solved as more than problems – you see them as opportunities to be realized. Your associates trust you and would use words like “collaborative” and “creative” to describe you. They might even go so far as to say that they are unusually comfortable with you swimming (a bit) in their lane because you add so much value when you do, and you always do it respectfully. You model behaviors and activities that set a standard for those around you. You care much more about getting the right things done than about who gets the credit for doing them. You are a “get stuff done” kind of person who gets things done so fast, efficiently, and effectively that it usually surprises those around you.Key Responsibilities:This Project Manager will report directly to the Head of Strategic Initiatives and drive critical projects for the Operations team from inception to completion, all of which ladder up to one of Grillo’s key strategic imperatives: “Develop Unmatched Seed to Table Expertise.” You will ensure that the cross-functional teams have a clear understanding of what each stakeholder is accountable for and monitor timelines to keep projects on track to a smooth completion.
