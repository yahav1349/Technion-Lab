VeraSafe,"Associate Privacy Attorney (Full Time, Remote Position)",Associate,"About VeraSafeVeraSafe is an innovative and successful U.S. headquartered privacy and cybersecurity compliance consulting firm and law firm. Due to rapid growth and increased demand for our international privacy and technology compliance and legal services, VeraSafe is seeking creative, motivated, and collaborative attorneys to join our team, regardless of prior work experience or education background. This is a fully remote position and will remain a fully remote position. Check out our other great benefits, listed at the end of this job description.About the RoleThis is an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to join a team working on the cutting edge of privacy and data protection, and who wants to further develop a practice in an in-demand, high-tech area of law. We are inundated with business from clients who love the way we advise on privacy compliance (hence the need for you!).We have found our strongest team members don’t necessarily have prior experience in privacy law. You’ll begin with a robust and established onboarding and training process and quickly begin attending client calls and doing substantive work.Note: There is a 1-3 hour skills assessment associated with the recruitment for this position. We know this is a burden, but we think it’s worth it, and we appreciate you taking the time to complete it. We’ve found it enables us to find the best attorneys, regardless of their experience, where they went to law school, or where they were trained. We want smart, kind, creative lawyers, plain and simple, and this assessment is a crucial part of our ability to hire this way.We are not your typical legal job. We use project managers to keep our remote team organized and our projects streamlined and on-track. We encourage our team members to travel and to make use of our ability to work as digital nomads, whether that means spending a month abroad or on extended trips to be near family. Because we’re a fully remote team, we’re also flexible about where you make your home base so long as you’re legally able to work and practice law there. We collaborate closely (you won’t feel like you’re working in isolation) and we actively encourage sharing of credit for work well done, resources, and advice (and penalize the reverse).We are not biglaw.

"Instructional Connections, LLC","Online Academic Coach (HigherEd, Remote, Part-Time)",Mid-Senior level,"Job DescriptionInstructional Connections, LLC is a fully integrated provider of high-quality instructional support services to colleges anduniversities that offer online courses and degree programs. Universities work collaboratively with Instructional Connections to deliver high-quality asynchronous courses at an affordable cost. Within the online course, students are assigned an Academic Coach (sometimes referred to by a different title for different programs - Teaching Assistant, Course Assistant, Instructional Associate, etc.). We are currently working with 55+ public and state universities (over 75 programs) and we’re expected to add several others in the coming year.ABOUT THE POSITION: Academic Coaches are highly qualified, experienced practitioners (minimum of a Master’s Degree or greater) who most frequently serve as the liaison between the university faculty of record and students within the assigned online course. The exact qualifications and requirements of an Academic Coach are tailored according to individual university and program needs. Often the Academic Coachis the student's initial point of contact and acts in a similar fashion that a traditional teaching assistant does in a university.Academic Coaches may grade assignments per faculty directions, monitor discussion threads, answer inquiries/emails within 24 hours, monitor student engagement, provide asynchronous student support, and regularly collaborate with the university faculty of record. Academic Coaches serve as facilitators and graders, while university faculty members are the instructor of record for the online course. Compensation is based on a per-student-per-course formula. About 75% of the courses are 5 to 9-week course cycles and the programs are year-round, with 4-7 course starts through the year.The average time per student, per week, is approximately 10-30 minutes; however this can vary on the level of the course, the specific course assigned, and the number of open-ended assignments within the course each week. Academic Coaches who consistently complete course assignments with quality and to the satisfaction of the faculty will be considered for additional sections or responsibilities. We do not want to over-extend a coach's responsibilities to such a degree that this negatively impacts their ability to serve students and meet expectations. In a first course assignment, the practical limit is up to 50 students, with 30 being more typical. The average experienced Academic Coach can support 75-90 students. A highly proficient coach with ample time may be assigned up to 120 students but this is the upper limit and monitored closely. Since we support all disciplines, various levels of courses (undergrad, graduate, and doctoral), and courses varying from 5 to 16 weeks in length; specific ""per-student-per-course"" rates and/or any potential additional stipends are not disclosed until a contracted Academic Coach is approved by a university and offered a specific upcoming course assignment.If selected to advance as a candidate, the candidate will be required to complete an Academic Coach Pre-Employment Screening course within our Learning Management System. Candidates can expect to commit 4 to 6 hours to the self-paced screening session, which is to be accomplished over one week (Monday through Sunday). This pre-employment screening session (virtual interview) will include specifics regarding the role and expectations of an Academic Coach, an introduction to learning management systems (LMS), and the various accepted best practices of delivering and facilitating online education courses, FERPA, APA, etc. If a candidate does not complete this screening session in the scheduled allotted time, he/she may request to be rescheduled for a future session. These sessions are only offered twice per month and always start on a Monday and end on Sunday.Upon successful competition of the screening (active participation, passing of all graded assignments, and working through all modules), candidates will be advanced to the contracting phase. Receiving a contract as an Academic Coach is dependent on the success of a criminal background check and the screening session results.

"Kerr Surveying, LLC",Land Survey Field Technician,Entry level,"Job DescriptionMission: (Why we exist as a company)“When one person stands to gain over another, the facts must be uncovered.”We believe that is the essential role of a survey company. We find the facts. We are not the mediator. Attorneys can discuss the meaning and implications of the facts that we uncover, and decisions can be made after the facts are known, but someone has to be willing to discover the truth.Our great state has been under the rule of six different sovereigns, each with equally complex legal principles. Discovering the truth, and making good decisions isn’t always simple.Vision:To protect the lands of TexasBuilding on our reputation that began in 1986 here in Brazos County, our vision is to grow the company to cover all of Texas within the next 10 years. That’s aggressive, but possible. Our plan is to create a culture 1st brand where people matter and quality is a priority. That means a lot of room for growth and opportunity for our staff.Core Values: (How we operate as a company)We took some time to articulate the culture and values that matter to us as a company. Culture isn’t having bean bag chairs, foosball tables, or free lunches in the company cafeteria (Although we do love Fuego tacos on Friday mornings.) Below is a list of our values along with a brief description of what each one means to us:Call Brad when you’re stuck: We once had someone get stuck in a company truck. Instead of calling the office, he called another crew to pull him out. That crew got stuck also. In the end, they called the office and it got handled, but wasted a lot of time. This value is about creating a judgement free zone. It’s ok to make mistakes here. Just let us know so we can help get it fixed. This also means that leadership has to create an environment that is safe to share what went wrong. You’ll be a part of this.Everyone’s welcome at the party: While we do work hard, we also want to have some fun at the party… where everyone is welcome. This is more than just saying you are welcome to be here, but actually feeling it to be true.Tree to Tree (Close enough) isn’t real: For some, “Good enough” is good enough. Where others may have cut corners, it is important that we hold ourselves to a higher standard. Just because there’s a fence there, that doesn’t mean it’s real. Let’s do the work and dig deep, even when it would be easier to call it.Real facts, good opinions: Our work is about precision, and then, making a decision based on information that has been in flux since the 1800s. Texas was once under the rule of six flags, with equally complicated rules for land surveying. We embrace the chaos, while making good judgements about the facts.Treasure hunters that share the map: if we share what we know, we all grow.Don’t move the stones: We respect traditions of the past and know that rules exist for a reason. While we seek to improve, we know that there are boundaries that are to be respected.Travel the untamed frontier: Survey work can be rough, and every job comes with a certain amount of adventure. You have to be ok with uncertainty and working in the elements to truly enjoy the profession. This also applies to learning new things, growing as people, and wanting to improve in all areas of life.Location:Our office is located in Aggieland (Bryan/College Station, in Brazos County, within the Texas Triangle of Dallas, Austin, and Houston, is a great community to raise a family. It isn’t Dallas, or Austin, or Houston. But we think it’s special and hope that you will love it too. If you are an Aggie that wants to return home, you will appreciate the unique environment here and what it can mean for quality of life for you and family.This community is growing, and so are we. Our plans call for us to hire close to 100 people over the next 10 years.The Office:The rest of this job posting attempts to describe the company that we aspire to be. To get there, we need good people and are committed to doing what it takes to improve and accomplish our goals. A “Culture 1st Brand” is what we are building, where we are focusing on a culture of accountability and performance… where people (and how they are treated) matter. If you’ve ever worked somewhere that didn’t provide both, you know how powerful that is when you go home from work each day.Every three months we take time away from work to meet for strategic planning. Together, every member of the team is invited to share what’s working, (what isn’t), and to contribute to a worthwhile goal of becoming better as people, as a team, and as a company.We do have fun, but we also get work done. Movie references sometimes can break the tension of a rough day while eloquently summarizing a situation to make it easier to understand.Normal Job Description Details:Survey Types We Currently Provide:Topographical SurveysLand Title Surveys (Though not a title mill)ALTA SurveysLand Boundary SurveysPartition SurveysBoundary SurveysSurveying for Platting purposesForm SurveysAs-Built Surveys of all sizes and scopeConstruction Surveying and StakingElevation CertificatesUtility Surveying and StakingBuilding EnvelopeWe use Carlson Survey, are improving our benefits, offer health insurance, financial performance bonuses when the company does well, and some other cool things that no one else offers.Note we are looking to hire for this position Summer 2024",Entry level,Full-time,Sales and Management,Civil Engineering,3874856855
